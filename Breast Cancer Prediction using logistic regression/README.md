
# Breast Cancer Detection Using  Logistic Regression

Determining whether tumor is benign or malignant based features such as clump thickness, Uniformity of  cell size, Uniformity of cell shape, Marginal adhesion, cell size, and mitoses.


## Install

 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
 - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

Code is provided in the `Breast Cancer detection using logistic regression.ipynb` notebook file. You must use the `breast_cancer.csv` dataset.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `"Breast Cancer Prediction using logistic regression"/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Breast Cancer detection using logistic regression.ipynb"
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset used here is found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).
This datset contains 569 instances and 32 attributes(ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features)
It contains no missing values and class distribution of 357 benign, 212 malignant.
